### InnoDB High Level Overview
![high-level-overview](http://p0iombi30.bkt.clouddn.com/innodbHigh-level%20Overview.png)
- **what is in the buffer pool**
  - index page 
  - data page
  - redo page
  - insert buffer
  - adaptive hash index
  - lock info
  - data dictionary
![innodb_buffer_pool](http://p0iombi30.bkt.clouddn.com/innodb%20buffer%20pool%202017-12-08%201.46.27.png)
- the default page size is 16KB
- innodb_buffer_pool_size and innodb_buffer_pool_instances
  - ```select pool_id, pool_size, free_buffers, database_pages from information_schema.innodb_buffer_pool_stats;``` #show buffer pool stats.
  - **innodb_buffer_pool_instances** divides the buffer pool into specified number of separate regions. each with its own LRU list and data structures. **The advantage** is to reduce contention during concurrent memeory.
  - buffer instance param will only take effect when **innodb_buffer_pool_size** is larger than 1GB, and recommend use multiple Gigebytes 
- from memory point of view, innodb has three types of page: clean page, dirty page and free page.
  - clean page, data in memory and in disk is identical
  - dirty page, not identical
  - free page, not used page
- innodb logically has data page type: 
```sql
select distinct page_type from information_schema.innodb_buffer_page_lru where;
-------page_type-------------
SYSTEM
INODE
IBUF_INDEX
INDEX
IBUF_BITMAP
TRX_SYSTEM
UNDO_LOG
FILE_SPACE_HEADER
BLOB
```
- LRU list, Free list and Flush list**
  - innodb use list to manage different pages.
  - LRU list saves already read page. Use midpoint tech to save lastest read page into LRU list. 
  - free list has all not used free page, when server starts, all the page are in free list, and move to LRU.
  - flush list contains all the dirty page. Use checkpoint to flush dirty data into disk. Dirty page may exist both in flush list and LRU list.
  - innodb_old_blocks_pct and innodb_old_blocks_time 
  ```show variables like '%innodb_old_block%'``` # innodb_old_blocks_pct sets percertage of old list, innodb_old_blocks_time sets the midpoint page will be in the hot part of LRU list after certain time.
  - ```show engine innodb status;``` #show the page info 
  ``` bash

![buffer pool](http://p0iombi30.bkt.clouddn.com/mysql%20innodb%20buffer%20pool%20metrics.png)
  - ```select * from information_schema.innodb_buffer_pool_stats``` # can also show the buffer pool stats.
  - **buffer poll hit rate** is the rate hit in memory not in disk, the higher the better
  - ```select * from information_schema.innodb_buffer_page_lru where compressed_size <> 0``` # compressed lru page
 - **redo log buffer**
    ```bash
    show variables like 'innodb_log_buffer_size';
    
    innodb_log_buffer_size	16777216
    ```
 - three conditions that flush data into disk
   - every 1s master thread trigger
   - every transaction
   - redo buffer free page less than 1/2
  
 - Dirty page checkout mechanization
  - **write-ahead-log** write to log before write page
  - the problem to solve:
    1. reduce database recover time
    2. flush data when buffer pool is full
    3. refresh dirty page when redo log is out of work
    
 - Insert buffer
  - primary key is the unique identification of the row, usually application insert rows based on auto-increased primary key. 
  if we insert primary key that is random, we may not get sequence data in disk
